== 🚀 Why Instant Image Generator? ==

Finding the right image for your blog post, page, or product shouldn't be a chore. Traditional workflows require you to open a new tab, search a stock photo website, download the image, switch back to WordPress, upload it, and then insert it. That's **6 steps** for a single image.

With Instant Image Generator, it's just **2 steps**: Search → Import. Done.

Whether you're a blogger crafting your next viral post, an agency building client websites, a WooCommerce store owner adding product images, or a content creator who needs fresh visuals daily — this plugin transforms your workflow and saves you hours every week.

**Instant Image Generator** integrates seamlessly into both the **WordPress Media Library page** and the **WordPress Media Modal** (the popup that appears when you click "Add Media" or set a Featured Image). This means you can access millions of images from anywhere in WordPress — while editing a post, creating a page, or managing your media.

== ✨ Key Features ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. Do I need API keys to use this plugin? =

**Not for all sources!** Pexels, Pixabay, and Openverse work completely **out of the box** with no API key required. You only need API keys for Unsplash, Giphy, OpenAI (DALL·E), and Google Gemini. All API keys are free to obtain from their respective developer portals. The plugin works great even if you only use the free sources that don't require keys.

= 2. Are the images free to use? Can I use them commercially? =

Yes! All images from **Pixabay** and **Pexels** are released under their respective free licenses that allow commercial use without attribution (though attribution is appreciated). **Unsplash** images are free for commercial and non-commercial use. **Openverse** images carry Creative Commons licenses — check individual image licenses before commercial use. **Giphy** GIFs are subject to Giphy's terms of service. **AI-generated images** (OpenAI/Gemini) are subject to the respective AI provider's usage policies.

= 3. How does the WordPress Media Modal integration work? =

When the plugin is active and the "Media Modal" setting is enabled (it's ON by default), an **"Instant Images"** tab automatically appears in the WordPress media selector popup. This is the same popup that appears when you click "Add Media" in the classic editor, "Set Featured Image," or use any media selection button. You can search and import images directly from this popup without leaving the page you're editing.

= 4. What happens when I import an image? =

When you click "Import," the plugin downloads the image from the source and uploads it directly to your **WordPress Media Library**. The image is saved in your `/wp-uploads/` folder just like any manually uploaded image. Depending on your settings, the plugin can automatically set the **Alternative Text** (for SEO), **Title**, and **Caption** (with author attribution like "Photo by John Doe"). The filename is generated from the image title for clean, SEO-friendly URLs.

= 5. Can I control what metadata is added to imported images? =

Absolutely! In **AI Image → Dashboard → General Settings**, you'll find three toggle switches under "Image Metadata on Import":

* **Alternative Text** — When ON, automatically sets the image's source title as the WordPress Alt Text (great for SEO and accessibility)
* **Image Title** — When ON, sets the source title as the WordPress attachment title
* **Image Attribution** — When ON, adds "Photo by [Author Name]" as the image caption

Each toggle works independently, so you can enable or disable any combination you prefer.

= 6. How does Global Search work? =

Global Search is a powerful feature that searches **all your enabled image providers simultaneously**. When you type a keyword in the Global Search tab, the plugin sends requests to Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash, Openverse, and Giphy at the same time and combines the results into a single masonry grid. Each image shows a provider badge so you know where it came from. If you disable a provider in your Dashboard settings, it's automatically excluded from Global Search results.

= 7. How do I generate AI images with OpenAI or Gemini? =

First, add your API key in **AI Image → Dashboard → Image Sources** (for OpenAI or Gemini). Then navigate to the **Image Generator** page and click the **OpenAI** or **Gemini** tab. Enter a descriptive text prompt (e.g., "A serene mountain lake at sunset with reflections") and click **Generate**. For Gemini, you can also choose the image size (512px, 1024px, or 2048px) and number of images (1-4). Generated images can be imported to your Media Library with one click, just like stock photos.

= 8. Can I reorder the image source tabs? =

Yes! Go to **AI Image → Dashboard → Image Sources**. You'll see all your providers listed as cards with drag handles. Simply **drag and drop** the cards to rearrange them, or use the **up/down arrow buttons** for precise positioning. The order you set here is reflected in the Image Generator page tabs. You can also enable or disable the **Global Search** tab separately with its own toggle at the top of the section. Click "Save Settings" to persist your changes.

= 9. What is the GIF animation control feature? =

To improve page performance and reduce visual clutter, **Giphy GIFs are displayed as still thumbnails by default**. When you hover your mouse over a GIF, it comes alive and starts animating. A small **"GIF"** badge with a play icon appears on each GIF card so you can easily identify animated content. In the full-size preview modal, GIFs always play at their full animation. This feature helps keep the gallery fast and responsive even when browsing hundreds of GIFs.

= 10. Does the plugin slow down my website? =

**No.** The plugin only loads its assets (JavaScript and CSS) on admin pages where they're needed — the Dashboard settings page, the Image Generator page, and admin pages where the WordPress Media Modal is available. It adds **zero frontend code** to your public-facing website. Your visitors will never notice the plugin is installed. The React-based interface is optimized for performance with lazy loading, debounced search, and efficient image rendering.
